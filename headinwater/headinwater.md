On the 14th of October 2012, I swam continuously for approximately 6 minutes and 45 seconds; 10 lengths of a smallish pool. To many of you that may not seem remarkable, or even worth writing down, but for me it was a considerable achievement. Here's why.

Since my youngest years I've been allergic to chlorine. Deemed unsafe to enter a public pool, I spent many hours as a young child sat on a hard aquamarine bench overlooking the six broad lanes of Queen Mary's Swimming Pool, the turgid and dense smell of the forbidden chlorine welling up in my nostrils, distracted from my book by the splashing sounds of mirth from my peers. I may not have been life-threateningly allergic then, or at all any more, but when exposure induces a months-long ritual of rubbing a mystical expensive white cream to rid me of the red rash that encircled my brittle body like ink blots spread across a vellum page, it is best not to find out.

My experiences as a child left me with an innate fear of the water. Normally I am an empirical human being rather than an emotional one, but try as I might the lonely fear of a large body of water - and especially losing one's depth, that visceral feeling of being displaced from a watery podium - remained. My mother will gladly tell you stories of my dread of any pool: once, as an infant on holiday in the balmy Caribbean, I was so scared of venturing into the middle of the hotel's pool that I dug my nails deeper and deeper into the red inflatable parrot that was there for my enjoyment, until it punctured and I grabbed for her again, leaving the deflated but still smiling parrot lapping limply on the rivulets from my struggle.

Before the 10th birthday party of a boy whose family was certainly the richest I shall ever know, but who I drifted apart from sometime later, a swimming race was advertised in their palatial basement pool. I was dropped off at their vast house bearing my body board, the latest attempt at improving my confidence in the water. Its garishly blue shiny surface, emblazoned with happy dolphins, must have nearly dwarfed me. Entering the pool for the much-anticipated race, the host's mother looked down at me, "Do you really need that?", she said, pointing at the happy blue dolphins. I remember nodding, looking at my feet. "Well if you must, but hurry, we're just about to start". I lost all the races anyway.

Learning to swim in the sea, my only feasible option, is no easy task. As a boy growing up we holidayed frequently on the island of Fuerteventura, pitched rockily in the mid-Atlantic, which at that time had little tourism and a pristine volcanic landscape. On its beaches my mother and I tried to get my spindly body comfortable in salt water. We settled on breaststroke as it was the easiest. But try as I might in the shallow lagoons that formed next to the thin beaches as the tide retreated and the sun dipped further towards the horizon, my feeble attempts at emulating the movements of a frog - the master swimmers of the amphibian kingdom and certainly the blueprint for any breaststroke practitioner - were lacklustre at best. Whilst I did manage to achieve positive buoyancy in the inland pools, any similar progress attempted offshore was quickly terminated by a large wave rolling in from the sand banks beyond, knocking me under into a tumbling world of grey and blue.

And so, after an interlude of more than ten years, I found myself in an unique situation this summer, the summer of 2014. Carrying out field research from a remote location that had a chlorine-free swimming pool, but little else to distract oneself, left me with two months to do something once and for all about my pathetic swimming ability as I rose into my third decade of existence. The process itself was oddly anticlimatic. I hated the first swim in the pool, but resolved brazenly to do it once a day if I could, and then got on with it. Every day I went, cleaning my body from the heat of the day with a swim before a pre-dinner shower - rather like the opposite tradition of a Japanese *onsen* - and the lengths slowly increased, 1 to 2, 2 to nearly 3. But the biggest break came when I finally shut my mouth, arched my neck further towards the off-white mosaic floor, and breathed noisily through my nose. I more than doubled the previous day's distance. All it took was learning to put my head in the water.

I am still far from a strong swimmer, or even a confident one, but with four weeks of pool access remaining in this unique summer situation, I feel I can, and will, improve slowly. My chlorine allergy isn't going to disappear, and I'll probably never experience the feeling of swimming alongside the common man at a communal pool. But for someone who's spent their life coming up with scores of excuses, and watched wistfully through steamy windows as classmates and adults alike splash around nonchalantly, being able to go for a swim with my friends sometime will be nice.
