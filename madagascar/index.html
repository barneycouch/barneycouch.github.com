    <p><h1>Madagscar: My Diary</h1></p>
    <p>
      As always seems to happen to me, the trip does not get off to a good start. One of the straps on my Osprey backpack, foolishly purchased the day before I set off, snaps at Earls&#8217; Court tube station, barely half an hour from home, on the way to the airport, and the bag slumps low down on my back, dragging me backwards under the heavy weight of the carry-on luggage, all the way to the airport. When I finally wave goodbye to Mum after many hugs, trek out to the next terminal at Heathrow for the plane to Johannesburg (flight 1 of 3), and sit down, there are more problems: I am next to two very young kids (for an overnight flight this does not bode well), and more seriously, when it comes to our departure time, the plane doesn&#8217;t go anywhere. We sit restlessly as the pilot makes an apology, then says, &#8220;of course, all the French air traffic controllers are on strike&#8221;. &#8220;Of course&#8221; - I should have known. After 2.5 hours on tarmac we finally crawl down the runway and take off. I sleep very poorly, worried about missing my connection on Johannesburg (which I now have only 30 minutes to catch), and the child asleep on my lap, whose preciously quiet slumber I don&#8217;t wish to disturb.

      Sure enough, I miss the connection in Johannesburg by 10 minutes. Trapped in the weird post-security area of the airport, the airline consoles me with a hotel room for the night, free meals, and the same plane tomorrow to Antananarivo, Madagascar&#8217;s capital, but it is of little use - I have missed my chartered flight to Anjajavy, the hotel and massive private wildlife reserve that is my final destination. So for a day I mope around inside my hotel room, catching up on watching films, unable to breathe fresh air, use any proper cutlery, or see the outside world, due to the airport regulations. Next day&#8217;s flight is nearly half full of players from the Namibian rugby team - as they squeeze their broad frames into the seats I wonder if we will ever manage to take off with all the extra weight! But we do, and land safely in Tana a few hours later. From the air the extent of deforestation and climate change is clear: the country is a dark red colour, rather than the green of the forest it should be, and on the ground the air is dry and warm.

      After another two agonising days cooped up in a hotel in Tana, I finally leave early for my flight to Anjajavy. The streets of Tana are busy even at 5:30am - everything from runners following each other down the dusty and broken pavements to ox carts full of supplies, and countless buses with place names in the window I can barely read - the Malagasy language is long and consonant-heavy. The tiny four-seat plane sputters along the runway and up above the clouds, and two hours later dives below the clouds, and falls sideways onto the tiny dirt runway. Afterwards the pilot just says, &#8220;it was very windy for the landing&#8221;, trying to look calm. Anjajavy is just as I remember it, the view out onto the azure of the ocean, the generous shade from canvas umbrellas onto the dark, smooth wood of the deck, the deep greens from the well-watered gardens that surround the lodge.

      There is only one guest at the lodge, an American called Terry, who has a kind face, a good laugh, and a set of stock phrases, his favourite being, &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you <em>right now</em>&#8230;&#8221;. I&#8217;m unsure of his background, until he says, &#8220;this is my last week, I&#8217;ve already been diving with Sharks in South Africa for a week, and done the migration in Kenya for a week&#8221;, and then, &#8220;it&#8217;s a nice break from Afghanistan&#8221;. I tell him about the structure and function of insects&#8217; compound eyes, and everything from my exams comes rushing back in a tidal wave of niche knowledge, and then I worry I&#8217;m boring him, but he seems to remain interested, and nods slowly. The manager, Cedric, proudly says that there are currently 120 staff working at the hotel, and that as the only guest he has the highest employee to visitor ratio in the world! It is not so hard to believe. After lunch I stroll up to the next bay, through the dusty, spiny forest. Halfway through I see a movement in the trees, and there they are, the animal I&#8217;ve come here to study for 9 weeks - the round, staring face of the Coquerel&#8217;s Sifaka, a wooly, slender, gorgeous lemur. It peers at me, as if short-sighted, and then I peer past it, and see one, two, three (and maybe four?) more, peering back at me, making a low throaty noise to communicate with each other, legs tucked up to their chests, with their beautiful chocolate-and-white <em>pelage</em> surprisingly well camouflaged against the greens and browns of the forest. They move slowly above me, in long effortless leaps and slow ascents and descents of small trees, always calling to each other, always turning to stare at me when I make any noise. Thankfully, they seem unconcerned by my presence.

      Later, further on up the next bay, the sun starts to dip, and I hurry back towards the camp. The sunset is sensational, the dark blood-orange ball of light slowly descending towards the dark sea, with riffled clouds dyed red as it dips lower, lower, and then out of sight. The afterglow is spectacular, and even as I stumble back through the dense forest, path illuminated by the feeble beam of my headlamp, the last rays of crimson spread through the trees. We eat on the beach, with a crackling fire near the table, and the waves lapping up the beach in the background. It is a magical evening.

      The next day, we visit the nearest town, also called Anjajavy, home to 2000 Malagasy. It is set on the bright white sand somewhat up from the beach, and each house follows the same basic plan: roofs thatched with palm leaves, walls from dry brittle wood, and a low overall height to protect against the terrible storms of the monsoon season. I stoop inside one: it is dark and smoky, and fingers of light peer in through the cracks between adjacent palm fronds. The kids at the school seem genuinely pleased to see us, and as I show them photos of Cambridge, they crowd round, silently bemused, pulling on my sleeves for a better view of the panelled halls and stone buildings that are quite literally half a world away. Outside one boy shouts, "photo, photo!", and I lean down to take one. He pulls the most gangster pose I've ever seen.
