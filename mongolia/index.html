    <p>The boy called Chimde, but who we all called Chimpy, on account of his prosimian demeanour, itched his glasses, relaced his boots, checked his dusty watch.</p>

    <p>Outside was still nothing, still steppe.</p>

    <p>K. was hunched up in the front, looking at the murky GPS. The signal was strong of course, because it was the desert.</p>

    <p>I was sitting on top of the suspension, as usual, all the kit sliding around the floor into my legs, into the rock-blasted wall, back into my legs.</p>

    <p>The van tilted down, over a staccato of pebbles, lurched off the track, the driver watching K.'s massive hand dance around the windscreen as it traced an imaginary road across the steppe.</p>

    <p>I watched the driver's watching K.'s massive hand. He seemed even more hunched than usual. He was always hunched, that's what came of being six-four, Irish-American, carrying a twelve-pocket field jacket everywhere.</p>

    <p>In the back the others were sleeping. Ukhdaar could slept almost anywhere, even in this beaten-to-shit Russian van with leaf springs and the engine on the inside so you could repair it in the winter, when it was too cold to touch metal outside; or in the summer, when it was also too hot to touch metal outside.
    One of the boys looked out the other side of the van, jabbing with an index finger.</p>

    <p>"There!"</p>

    <p>One spindly tree stood at the edge of the steppe.</p>


    <p>***</p>

    <p>In the desert here it got hot in the day, really hot. Forty-five degrees celsius. So hot your appetite ran away like the antelope mirages I was chasing around the steppe.</p>

    <p>Your thirst caught it up - five bottles of water, minimum, for a hike across the dusty rocks. In my nightmares I walked off without any water, into the heat haze, the gerbils with the big ears erasing my tracks.</p>

    <p>In the night it was cold, and we watched the satellites stream across the inky sky over our camp, crouched in the small gully. Its white tents huddled around the only reliable spring for hundreds of kilometres around.</p>

    <p>Nobody bothered charging the satellite phone - who were you going to call for help?</p>


    <p>***</p>

    <p>On Thursday I went out with Altangerel. He wore his antenna slung across his back, and his water slung across his front, and his GPS and binoculars slung either side. The antenna knocked the GPS and the binoculars and we rattled across the steppe listening to static on the radio.</p>

    <p>Altangerel couldn't speak English, so we spent a lot of time looking in the same direction. One evening I caught him playing basketball on the court studded with goatheads, and we shot hoops in the half-light, hands prickled like a cactus.</p>

    <p>Towards the end I watched him fix his motorbike carburettor with a rusty swiss army knife and a can of baked beans. You could tell he was Mongol. </p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p><em>The problem</em>, D. was saying, <em>is that the parents fly off as soon as they see you. No matter how hard you try, they see you first. How can you compete with a vulture's eyesight?</em></p>

    <p>If you get the young at the right time (and D. always knew the right time, somehow), they sit on the nest, trying to flap, knowing they're unfledged, struggling to use their barndoor wings.</p>

    <p>If you're too late (and that season, we were too late) they're quarter-fledged, and drop from the tree, canter across the steppe, flapping and flapping their barndoor wings, still scuffling across the rocks, and Chimpy would run behind them trying to hell not to break his legs whilst trying to stop them from breaking their wings, until a ball of khaki and feathers, breathing heavily together, would come to a halt far far in the distance. With the dust rising silently, we'd edge closer.</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>Their breath is foul, of course, but they eye you like a madman whilst you grip their wrinkled onyx talons, eyeing you and everything else, even their parents wheeling around three thousand metres up.</p>

    <p>Chimpy and D. and K. didn't use gloves - so I didn't either, but god I was worried every time it flapped those hugs wings and shifted under the weight of four grown men. No question of tagging the adults.</p>

    <p>Then it was done, and the clipboard went back, and the big old barndoor wings had a target stapled in - <em>it barely feels a thing</em> - and Chimpy would be tottering up a ladder, taking it back to bed whilst the parents kept wheeling above.</p>

    <p>And we'd drive off, and the juvenile black-backed vulture would recede into the spiny distance, a ball of intensity and attention and mass, nearly ready to leave the tree forever, and fly four thousand kilometres east.</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>Like you I'd travelled a lot before, travelled a lot since. But vigenettes from that one long summer stick immutably in my mind. </p>

    <p>When it was thirty-five inside the <em>ger</em> and forty-five outside, so hot you couldn't sleep, just wriggle like sweaty dogs on the little carved beds watching the water trickle through the gravity filter, playing <em>74</em> with Chimpy over and over and over again.</p>

    <p>At the traps in the early mornings, burrowing rodents scattering across the dirty yellow rock as the sun peeked out over the boulder stacks and poked long amber fingers that spread through the steppe quicker than you could pace.</p>

    <p>And in the quiet moments, when Ukhdaar and K. and D. were back at camp, and I picked my way through the broken crust of the Gobi, the desert that is barren but alive, feeling like the only man on earth. You could climb an escarpment and look for ten or twenty miles, with no evidence of humanity ever existing. No roads, no planes, no noises, not even the scuffle-line of your footsteps. It was unfathomably beautiful.</p>
